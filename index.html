              <h3>Survival Simulator</h3>
              <p>A simulator that lets you create custom characters and the watch them brutally fight each other, or if you're too lazy to do that, randomize your characters. That's still fun. I think. My version of BrainSteele's Hunger Games Simulator. Have fun!</p>

              <h3>Duck Clicker</h3>
              <p>In this game you click a duck. For this, you earn a piece of currency (a "duck"). When you have earned enough ducks, you may buy upgrades to automate your production of ducks, which then lets you buy more upgrades, createing an infinte process of earning and spending ducks for the sake of the process itself, exposing the inherent flaws of the capitalist system. </p>

              <h3>A Browser Game</h3>
              <p>This is a browser game. In which there is a button. That you click. And earn achievements. There is nothing else to the game. Why would there be? Its a game about clicking a button. Just take it for what it is. Also, no matter what, keep your hands of the lock, please.</p>

              <p>A social credit site for my friends at the DSS. Glory to the CCP! This is unfinished and not under development.
                  I might finish it some time in the future but for now it lies dormant.</p>
